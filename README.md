![Animated weights of sono](documentation/sono-hey.gif "animated weights")

Seven weights: ExtraLight through ExtraBold. Sono Sans is proportional width glyphs/spacing with kerning. Sono is fixed-width (and obviously not kerned). Variable version (mono, wght) works in Figma 👍 Soon to be on Google Fonts.
